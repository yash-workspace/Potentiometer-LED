# Potentiometer-LED
Objective: To control LED brightness using a potentiometer.

Hardware (Simulated): Arduino Nano, Potentiometer, LED, .

Key Concepts: analogRead(), Serial.begin(),Serial.println().

How it Works:This project is about controlling LED using potrntiometer.
In this project I have coded Arduino NANO Board using analog pins.
Unlike other projects where digital pins are used i use analog pins and INPUT function.

Toolchain: PlatformIO + simulide.
